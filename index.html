        <div class="answer">
          <p>React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications where data changes over time.</p>

        <div class="answer">
          <p>React was developed by Facebook and is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies.</p>

          <span>Why use React?</span>
          <i class="fa-solid fa-caret-down"></i>
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>React simplifies the development of complex, interactive UIs by providing reusable components, efficient DOM updates via a virtual DOM, and a declarative programming style.</p>
        </div>

          <span>What are components in React?</span>
          <i class="fa-solid fa-caret-down"></i>
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>Components are the building blocks of a React application. They are self-contained units that can be independently developed and maintained.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

        <div class="question" >
          <span>What is the Virtual DOM?</span>
          <i class="fa-solid fa-caret-down"></i>
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>The Virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the actual DOM. React uses it to optimize updates by only re-rendering parts of the DOM that have changed, improving performance.</p>

      </div>

          <span>What is JSX?</span>
          <i class="fa-solid fa-caret-down"></i>
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that looks similar to HTML. It allows you to write XML-like code for elements and components, which gets transformed into JavaScript.</p>

      <div class="card" id="q7">
        <div class="question" >
          <span>What are props in React?</span>
          <i class="fa-solid fa-caret-down"></i>
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>Props (short for properties) are read-only attributes passed from parent components to child components, allowing data to flow in one direction.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      
      <div class="card" id="q8">
        <div class="question" >
          <span>What is state in React?</span>
          <i class="fa-solid fa-caret-down"></i>
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>State is an object that holds data or information about the component. Unlike props, state can change over time and trigger re-rendering of the component.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      
      <div class="card" id="q9">
        <div class="question" >
          <span>What are hooks in React?</span>
          <i class="fa-solid fa-caret-down"></i>
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>Hooks are functions that allow you to use state and other React features in functional components. Examples include useState and useEffect.</p>
